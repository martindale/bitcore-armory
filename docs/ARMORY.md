## Watch-Only Information

With the Watch-Only information, bitcore-armory can derive all public keys, without having access or any means to generate private keys.

This means that it can generate the exact same addresses Armory uses, allowing you to create tool that handle these addresses, usually for monitoring purposes.

To retrieve the Watch-Only information:

1. Double click on your wallet:
